# Shared Traits

I had this idea for a social media app that matched people with similar hobbies. I am no longer working on this and certainly didn't finish it, so it's very rough around the edges.

## Getting Started

Running this is not recommended because it's underwhelming for the effort required to run it, but it's an application using the MERN stack.

### Prerequisites

   - [Shared Traits API](https://github.com/CharlieEngler3/api.sharedtraits.com)
   - [Node JS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

  1.) Import the example databases from the Shared Traits API into MongoDB

  2.) Install all necessary packages for the front end and back end with the command:
  
    npm install

  3.) In the front end folder, use the following command to start the front end of the website:
  
    npm start
  
  4.) In the back end folder, use the following command to start the back end server:
  
    nodemon index.js
      
  5.) Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in a browser
